Programming Using Java

TOPIC: ARRAYS

Task 1
Fill an array of 15 elements with Fibonacci numbers. Output

only the even elements of the array to the console.

Task 2
Fill an array of 30 elements with random numbers from -70
to +50. Find the minimum element and output it to the console.
Find the maximum element and output it to the console.

Task 3
Write  a  program  that  checks  whether  all  values  of  array
elements  are  identical.  Output  Yes  if  they  are  identical,  and
No if there is at least one difference. The array is specified and
initialized at the beginning of the program.

Task 4
Write  a  program  that  checks  whether  all  values  of  array
elements are different (they are not repeated). Output Yes if they
are different and No if there is at least one repetition. The array is
specified and initialized at the beginning of the program.

Task 5
Fill an array of 10 elements with random numbers from -10
to  +10.  Calculate  the  number  of  duplicate  values.  Output  only
duplicate items and the number of repetitions to the console.

Example:

0 – 5 times
2 – 3 times
7 – 1 time

Task 6
Fill an array of 10 elements with random numbers from -10 to
+10. Count the number of unique values (occurring in the array
once).  Output  values  of  unique  elements  and  indexes,  under
which they are in the array, to the console.

Task 7
Fill  an  array  of  dimension  n  with  random  numbers  from  3
to 13. Calculate how many times each digit occurs. Output the
result to the screen. n is specified from the keyboard.

Task 8
Fill  an  array  of  dimension  n  with  random  lowercase  Latin
letters.  Calculate  how  many  times  each  letter  occurs.  Output
letters  that  occur  more  than  3  times.  n  is  specified  from  the
keyboard.

Task 9
Fill  an  array  of  dimension  n  with  random  numbers  from  -2
to n. If there is at least one negative value in the array that is less
than -1, replace all negative values in the array by the square (by
the power of 2) of these values. Output the source and resultant
array to the console.

Task 10
Fill  an  array  of  dimension  n  with  random  numbers  from  0
to 33. Find the element of the array that is divided by the value
of  the  element  on  the  left  and  the  value  of  the  element  on  the
right without remainder. Output values of the source array to the
console. Output the index of the found element; if it is not found,
output -1. n is specified from the keyboard.

Task 11
Fill  an  array  of  dimension  n  with  words  consisting  of  only
lowercase  Latin  letters. The  words  are  separated  by  spaces,  and
the number of spaces is random from 1 to 5. Calculate the total
number of words in the array. n is specified from the keyboard.

Task 12
The program should output the word yes for a symmetric array
and the word no for an asymmetric array. Symmetric array is an
array, in which values of the elements from the end is equal to the
value of elements from the beginning. The array is specified and
initialized at the beginning of the program.

1, 2, 3, 2, 1
2, 2, 3, 2, 2
1, 3, 2, 3, 1
5, 4, 3, 4, 5
