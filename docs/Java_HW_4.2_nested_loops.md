Programming Using Java

TOPIC: NESTED LOOPS

In tasks from 1 to 5, using the branching and loop operators, write
a program, whose algorithm will output geometric figures in the
form of asterisks to the console (pseudographics). The faces of the
figures should be smooth, the figures should be symmetrical. The
height of each figure should be specified from the keyboard. You
can use the output of only one asterisk in System.out.print (“*”).

Task 1
Rectangular triangle with a right
angle  down-right.  Filled  and
empty.

Task 2
Rectangular triangle with a right
angle up-right. Filled and empty.

Task 6
Draw a ladder on the screen. The number of steps is indicated

by the user from the keyboard.
Example of a ladder of 3 steps:

Task 7
A positive integer of any length is entered from the keyboard.
This number should be upside down, i.e., the digits should be in
the reverse order (for example, enter the number 1234 – the result
will be 4321).

Do not use strings and arrays.

Task 8
An  integer  of  any  length  is  entered  from  the  keyboard.  The
program should determine and output to the console the number
of digits in this number, as well as the sum of these numbers.

Task 9
It is necessary to draw a fir-tree with asterisks. Each new layer
should be wider than the previous one. The number of layers and
the  height  of  the  first  (upper)  layer  of  the  fir-tree  (the  number
of rows in the layer) are entered from the keyboard. The fir-tree
should be symmetrical.

Task 10
Write  a  program  that  will  read  any  number  (from  0  to
99999999) from the console and display its digits in the form of
asterisks (see the figure).

Example for the number 41072819:
