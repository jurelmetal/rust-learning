Programming Using Java

TOPIC: STRINGS

Task 1
Enter  a  string  of  text  from  the  keyboard,  followed  by  one
character. Output indexes and the number of matches (look for
occurrences of a character in a string) to the console. If no match
is found, output the corresponding text.

Task 2
Write  a  program  that  creates  a  string,

in  which  all
the  integers  starting  from  1  are  written  out  in  one  line
“123456789101112131415...”.

The string should be no longer than 1000 characters.
For the number n (entered from the keyboard), output the digit

on the n position (numbering starts with 1).

Task 3
Calculate  the  average  word  length  in  the  sentence  entered

from the keyboard.

Task 4
Enter a string from the keyboard (Latin). Select all words that
start  with  vowels  and  end  with  consonants  from  the  entered
string. Output the selected words to the console.

Task 5
Enter  a  string  from  the  keyboard. The  string  should  contain
words that can be separated by spaces or colons. It is necessary
to calculate the number of words in the string that have an even
number of letters.

Task 6

In the American army, the number 13 is considered unlucky,
and  in  Chinese  army,  the  number  4  is  considered  unlucky.
Before the joint exercises with the US and Chinese army, the
Army  Headquarters  of  the  Ukraine  decided  to  exclude  the
numbers  of  military  equipment  containing  numbers  4  or  13
(for  example,  40123,  13373,  12345  or  61342)  in  order  to  not
confuse foreign colleagues.
Write  a  program  that  will  display  how  many  numbers  will
have  to  be  excluded  if  the  army  has  100,000  units  of  military
equipment and each military vehicle has a number from 00000 to
99999. Solve it using strings.

Task 7
The  user  enters  any  string  from  the  keyboard.  Change  all
capital letters to lowercase letters and lowercase letter to capital
letters in the source string. If the string contains digits, replace
them with an underscore and output the result to the console.

Task 8

In  Java,  the  first  word  in  the  variable  name  starts  with  a
lowercase  Latin  letter,  the  next  word  is  written  with  a  capital
letter (only the first letter of the word is capital), and the words
have no separators and consist only of Latin letters. For example,
the  correct  entries  for  variables  in  Java  may  look  like  this:
javaIdentifier, longAndMnemonicIdentifier, name, nEERC.
In  C  ++,  only  small  Latin  characters  and  the  “_”  character,
which separates non-empty words from each other, are used to
describe variables. If the string has a mixed syntax, for example,
java_Identifier,  report  this.  Examples:  java_identifier,  long_
and_mnemonic_identifier, name, n_e_e_r_c.

You need to write a program that converts a variable written
in one language to the format of another language. The variable
identifier  (name)  should  be  entered  from  the  keyboard.  The
program should determine, from which language the variable is
taken and change it to a variable of another language. Output the
result to the console.

Task 9
Write  a  program  that  checks  whether  a  string  is  anagram
of  another  string  (the  string  can  consist  of  several  words  and
punctuation  symbols).  Spaces  and  punctuation  should  be
ignored when analyzing. The difference in capital and lowercase
letters  should  be  ignored.  Both  strings  should  be  entered  from

the keyboard. The program should display Yes if the strings are
anagram and No otherwise.
Example of an anagram:
Creative – Reactive,
Listen – Silent

Task 10
Write  a  program  that  will  print  a  rhombus  pattern  based  on
a string entered from the keyboard (the maximum length is 50
characters).

Example of the output of the “testing” string:

          t
        te
      tes
     test
    testi
  testin
testing
esting
sting
ting
ing
ng
g

Task 11

Words  in  the  Mumba-Yumba  language  can  consist  only  of
letters a, b, c, and in this case:
 ■ they never contain two letters b in a row,
 ■ a word never contains three identical subwords in a row. For
example, according to this rule, the following words cannot be
included in the Mumba-Yumba language: aaa (since it contains
the subword a three times in a row), ababab (since it contains
the subword ab three times in a row), aabcabcabca (since it
contains the subword abc three times in a row).

All  words  that  satisfy  the  above  rules  are  included  in  the
Mumba-Yumba language.
Write  a  program  that  determines  whether  the  given  word

(entered from the keyboard) belongs to this language.

Task 12
Write a program that will count the number of smiles in the

given text.

The  sequence  of  characters  will  be  considered  a  smile  if  it

satisfies the following conditions:
 ■ the first character is either ; (semicolon) or : (colon) exactly once;
 ■ further the - (minus) character can follow it any number of

times (including 0 times);

 ■ at the end, there should be some number (at least one) of the

same braces from the following set: (,), [,];
 ■ no other characters can be inside the smile.

For example, the following sequences are smiles:

:)
;---------[[[[[[[[

whereas these sequences are not smiles (although some of them
contain smiles):

:-)]
;--
-)
::-(
:-()
