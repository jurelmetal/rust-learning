Programming Using Java

TOPIC:  LOOPS

Task 1

Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers, in which the first
two numbers of the sequence are 0 and 1, and each successive
number is equal to the sum of two preceding ones.
Output all Fibonacci numbers in the range from 0 to 10,000,000

to the screen.

Task 2

A prime number is a natural (positive integer) number that has
exactly two varying natural divisors, one and itself. In other
words, the number N is prime, if it is greater than 1 and is thus
divisible without remainder by only 1 and N (itself).
Write  a  program  that  displays  all  the  prime  numbers  in  the
range from 2 to 1,000,00. Try not to perform unnecessary actions
(for example, after you have found at least one nontrivial divisor,
it is already clear that the number is composite and you do not
need to continue the check). Also note that the smallest divisor
of a natural number n, if there is any, is located in the interval
[2; √n].

Task 3

A narcissistic number or an Armstrong number is a natural
number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to
the power of the number of its digits.
Output  all  Armstrong  numbers  in  the  range  from  10  to

1,000,000 to the screen.

For example:
153 = 13 + 53 + 33

Task 4

A perfect number is a natural number that is equal to the sum
of all its own divisors (that is, all positive divisors different from
the number itself).
Display all the perfect numbers in the range from 0 to 1,000,000.
Examples:
The 1st perfect number, 6, has the following own divisors: 1, 2,
3; their sum is 6.
The 2nd perfect number, 28, has the following own divisors: 1,
2, 4, 7, 14; their sum is 28.

Task 5
Write a program that will check whether the number entered
from  the  keyboard  is  a  palindrome  (equally  readable  in  both
directions). For example, 123454321 or 221122 is a palindrome.
The program should output YES if the number is a palindrome,
otherwise NO.

Task 6
Output all eight-digit numbers, in which digits do not repeat, to
the console. These numbers should be divisible by 12345 without
a remainder. Show the total number of numbers found.

Task 7
Show bit representation of the value of a variable of the int type,
using only one loop, a control variable, output to the console, and
bit operations.

Do not use strings and any other ready-made functions (methods).

Task 8
The electronic clock shows time in the format from 00:00 to
23:59. Write a program that will output to the console, how many
times a day it happens that a symmetrical combination on the left
from the colon is shown for the combination on the right from the
colon (for example, 02:20, 11:11 or 15:51). Display all symmetrical
combinations. Print the total number of combinations.

Task 9
If we list all natural numbers less than 10, multiples of 3 or 5,

we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5 starting

from 0 and up to 1000.

Task 10
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided into each of
the numbers from 1 to 10 without a remainder. Write a program
that calculates the smallest positive number, which is divided by
all numbers from 1 to 20.

Task 11
Write a program that displays numbers from 1 to 1000. In this
case, instead of numbers that are multiples of three, the program
should  output  the  word  fizz,  and  instead  of  numbers  that  are
multiples  of  five,  the  word  buzz  should  be  outputted.  If  the
number is a multiple of fifteen, then the program should output
the word hiss instead of the number.

Task 12
The first day an athlete ran x kilometers, and then every day he
increased the mileage by 10% from the previous value. According
to  the  number  y  indicated  from  the  keyboard,  determine  the
number of the day, when the athlete’s mileage will be at least y
kilometers.
