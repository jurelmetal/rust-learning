Programming Using Java

TOPIC: MULTIDIMENSIONAL ARRAYS

Task 1
Build  an  array,  the  elements  of  which  are  squares  of  the

corresponding indexes. Output the result to the screen.

Task 2
Create an array of 20 random numbers in the range from -10
to 30. Write a program that determines the sum of array elements
in  the  array  after  the  first  negative  element  (the  first  negative
element must not be included in the sum). Output the obtained
array and the sum to the console.

Task 3
Create an array of 200 random numbers in the range from 0 to
200. Determine the amount of one-figure, two-figure, and three-
figure numbers percentage-wise. Output the obtained array and
the number by units.

Example:

digit 1 = 4
digit 2 = 45
digit 3 = 39

Task 4
Create an array of 100 random numbers in the range from
-300 to 555. Write a program that copies one array to another
in the following way: first, all elements greater than 0, then all
elements  equal  to  0,  then  all  elements  less  than  0  are  copied
successively.  Output  the  source  array.  Output  the  resulting
array.

Task 5
Create an array of 20 random numbers in the range from -10
to 20. Determine the maximum number of consecutive positive
elements that are not interrupted by zeros or negative numbers.
Output the source array and the found fragment to the console.

Task 6
Create a square array of the n dimension filled with random
numbers, output the array to the screen in a table, find the smallest
and the biggest array element and output them to the screen (if
there  are  several  equal  elements,  output  the  row  and  column
indexes of repetitions). Output search time in milliseconds. Array
dimensions must be set from the keyboard.

Task 7
Fill the n dimension square array with ascending numbers, in
the S shape. Output the result to the screen in compliance with
the columns width.

Task 8
Fill the n dimension square array with numbers that increase
by 1 spiral-wise (the n number must be set from the keyboard).
Output the result to the screen in compliance with the columns
width. For example, the 4x4 array must look as in the example.

Additionally: do this task using only one array + 1 point.

Task 9
There are numbers n and m. Create an array of the dimensionality
[n][m]  and  fill  it  with  numbers  diagonally  as  shown  in  the
example. Output the result to the screen in compliance with the
columns width.

Task 10

There are n rows of m seats in a cinema (m and n must be set
from the keyboard). Information on the sold tickets is stored in a
two-figure array of the m by n dimensionality. Number 1 means
that the ticket for the given seat is already sold, number 0 means
that the seat is vacant. There is a request on selling k tickets for
neighboring seats in one row (k must be set from the keyboard).
Determine whether it is possible to comply with this request.
If there are  solutions, output numbers of rows and numbers  of
vacant seats for selling.

The  number  of  taken  seats  and  what  seats  are  taken  at  the

moment of request should be determined randomly.

Output the source array to the screen.

Task 11
Enter from the keyboard an ordinal number in the range from
0 to 1 000 000 inclusive. Write them in letters. Mind that ordinal
numbers have different endings, for example, twenty-third, one
hundred and sixty-fifth, etc.

For example, when entering 1125, the program must output to

the console “one thousand and twenty-fifth”.

Task 12
Fill  a  square  array  of  the  n  size  with  the  knight’s  move  (the
knight’s move is L shaped). There is a simple algorithm that allows
filling the board with the knight’s move of the size from 5 to 70.
That is, fill the array with number 0 first, and then put number
1  on  the  first  square  (array  element),  2  on  the  next  one,  where
the  knight  steps,  and  so  on  until  there  is  no  squares  on  which
the knight haven’t stepped. If there are zero values, the algorithm
works  incorrectly.  Output  the  array  to  the  screen.  The  array
dimensionality must be set from the keyboard (See. The knight’s
tour).

It is recommended to use the Warnsdorf ’s rule to solve this
problem.
